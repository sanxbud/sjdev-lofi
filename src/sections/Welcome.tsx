My goal is to make low-friction tools and apps that make peopleâ€™s lives easier, help create the frameworks and systems that can get people closer to their goals, and do as much as I can to help build a more empathetic and human-centred world. Everyone's on their own journey, and we all do a little better when we help each other out :)`
